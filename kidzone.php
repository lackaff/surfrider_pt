						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>Passionate surfers started coming together at Surfrider to put an end to pollution in 1984! That’s a pretty long time, right?</p>

<p>Since then, Surfrider has been working hard with its employees and tons of volunteers like you to help fight the battle of keeping the oceans clean. When kids choose to become a protector of the coast, they help keep things like your bath and drinking water clean, and give you clean oceans and beaches to enjoy!</p>

<p>But even though Surfrider has had plenty of help over the years, it still needs help from you. Talk to your Mom and Dad about helping out at Surfrider, so you can become a protector of the coast too! Ask if you can volunteer at the next Surfrider beach clean or talk to someone at your school about how to become a member.</p>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>

<p>Surfrider Ericeira tries to keep beaches and oceans clean by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Hanging out in schools with kids and teachers to tell everyone about why they need to be green and make good choices for the earth.</li> 
		<li>Help cleaning beaches so your can family safely have fun at the beach.</li>
	</ul>

						<h2>Ready To Catch Your First Wave?</h2>
<img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/surfer.png" class="span3 pull-right" />
<p>Catching your first wave as a surfer can be a pretty big deal. Getting up on the board for the first time correctly can take a lot of time and effort, but once you’re there it can make for a memory that will stick with you for a while.  Here are some quick tips to make sure catching your first wave is awesome!</p>
<dl>
<dt><h5>Be patient</h5></dt>
<dd>Before you get started, decide you won’t get too frustrated! Surfing is supposed to be fun, and it will be. But things can be pretty tough in the beginning. You’ll take some pretty rough tumbles and maybe get a few knicks or scratches. Make sure you give yourself some time to relax and take in your beautiful surroundings when you need a break.</dd>
<dt><h5>Be persistent</h5></dt>
<dd>Good surfers have a determined attitude! They work hard and aren’t afraid to fall off their board a time or two. The only way to get better is to keep practicing!</dd>
<dt><h5>Be confident</h5></dt>
<dd>Don’t be afraid! People of all ages can learn to surf. People old and young can do it, so you can too. You’re never too young or old to get started if you have the right help! </dd>
<dt><h5>Be smart</h5></dt>
<dd>If you’re going to surf, you’ve got to have the right equipment and help along the way! 
<ul><li>Pick the right board. As far as boards go, you’ll probably want a foam surfboard to start. They’re great for beginners, offer a ton of flotation and don’t hurt as much when they bump into you. They can be a little heavy though. If you’re just trying out surfing for the first time, it might be best to convince your Mom and Dad to help you rent one first. If they decide to buy instead, ask them to read our guide to surfing sustainably. If they go with a foam board to start, selling can be fairly easy.</li>
<li>Get the right help. If you’re trying out surfing for the first time, you’re going to need an experienced surfer out there to help you in the water. Surfrider’s friends over at Pocean Surf Academy can get you started. Mention them to Mom or Dad. They teach people of all ages how to surf and give you the push you need to become a great surfer. </li>
</ul> 
</dd>
<dd><h5>Be Green</h5>If you’re spending the day trying to learn how to surf at the beach, make sure your keep an eye on all your trash! This might sound silly, but respecting the environment is an important part of becoming a respectable surfer. The water and beach belongs to everyone, so keeping it all clean means everyone there gets to have a great experience. Get in the habit of disposing of food wrappers and plastics in the right place when you wrap up a day at the beach. This way, everyone can enjoy the Ericeira coastline!</dd>
